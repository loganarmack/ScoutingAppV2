# ScoutingAppV2

This is the second version of the scouting app for Lisgar's FRC team, #7267. It facilitates the gathering and compilation of data
about the competing robots. This app was developed for the 2019 game, Destination: Deep Space.

### What is FRC?

FRC stands for FIRST Robotics Competition. It is the biggest robotics competition for high school students across the world, with
hundreds of thousands of students working in teams to build the best robot possible for the year's game. Each year, FIRST creates
a new game, with new rules and challenges, and teams are given a 6-week build period in which to build and program their robot. This
app was created for the 2019 game, to aid our team with pit scouting (gathering data about a robot before its matches). You can get a
quick rundown of the rules of that game [here](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/game-and-season).

### What does this app do?

This app lets users input various pieces of data about a team's robot; things like how high it can score hatches and cargo, or how
high it can climb. After entering this data, it either uploads it directly to an online server (with internet) or stores it to a file
(no internet). This list of teams can then be viewed in the app, or can be exported as json, which can be converted into an excel
spreadsheet for easy analysis.

### How can I run the app?
